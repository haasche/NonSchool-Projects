# NonSchool-Projects
Personal Ventures

This is the INCOMPLETE edition of the public version bot released in November of 2016 for OSRS. 
It runs what agility course you wish it to run via the RUNEMATE interface. 

This bot is not complete nor fully publicly released, but rather a large portion of a completed project 
designed to showcase my talents and abilities (at the end of 2016) to the public who may be interested. 

If you have ANY questions or concerns, feel free to email me @ haasche@gmail.com

Thanks,
Eric
